### Making ultra your own: UEF for Beginners

⏲ 11:30 PM - 12:15 PM Session
<br/>
👨‍💻 **Presenter:** Chris Filkins

For years, many of us have relied on Building Blocks as a way to add features and functionality into our Blackboard Learn courses.  One of the best tools we ever used was the javascript Hacks tool, which leveraged the renderingHook function to allow a system administrator to further modify and customize their Learn environment with custom tools, banner, footers, etc.  Unfortunately, the Ultra experience no longer supports the renderingHook function, removing the key mechanism for these customizations. 

In order to restore some of these capabilities, Blackboard Learn implemented a new feature set called the Ultra Extension Framework (UEF).  This new framework opens a number of doors for developers to once again customize and extend their Blackboard Learn environments after switching to the Ultra experience.  The Ultra Extension Framework consists of two key components – telemetry data for user activity, and injection points to add content at various locations within the Ultra interface. 

The telemetry data can include a number of different events, including hover, click, route, as well as portal windows being created and removed.  After initially launching as an LTI tool, an UEF tool can subscribe to any number of these events, and typically runs as javascript inside of a hidden iframe within the Ultra interface.  From there, the custom script can then submit requests to the Ultra interface to create new panels, banners, notifications, popups, or even a custom help provider. 

The attached presentation will provide some sample code snippets from projects that we have deployed in our production environment, including banners and custom help providers.

### Best Practices for Building Your LTI Advantage & REST Applications For Learn, From Registration through Release

⏲ 9:00 AM - 9:45 PM Session
<br/>
👨‍💻 **Presenter:** Mark Kauffman

In this session Mark will give best practices for integrations that use LTI 1.3 and/or the Blackboard Learn REST APIs. There are many ways to improve your integration's performance and use, beginning with registration on the developer portal through the day it's installed on client systems. Given Mark's extensive experience working with 3rd-party integrations, he's selected those commonly missed best practices that, when you use them, will position your integration for maximum success.
