# LTI 1.3 tools must generate their own keys and JWKS URL 

When we started supporting LTI 1.3/Advantage (back in May of 2019) we chose to generate public/private key pairs for the tools. The tool vendor was then responsible for copying and storing those values on their side. 

But the [IMS Global](https://imsglobal.org) community has moved away from that model and now suggests that tool vendors generate their own key pairs for LTI authentication and provide their public key via a [JWKS URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517). This model is more secure because there is not copying of a private key and allows the LTI Tool provider to follow best practices with key rotation. 

We decided to follow that suggestion. If you want to register a new tool with Blackboard, you have to provide the JWKS URL information. And if you have an existing tool that use the Blackboard-generated private key, please keep in mind that we'll be terminating support in the near future. 

As always, if you have any questions, check out the [contact us page](/community/contact) and let us know!
