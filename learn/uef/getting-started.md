# Blackboard's Ultra Extension Framework
## Introducing Blackboard’s Ultra Extension Framework

We’re excited to introduce a new means of integration with the Blackboard Learn Ultra Experience, known as the Ultra Extension Framework (UEF). The UEF is a set of Premium APIs that augment the Ultra experience of Blackboard Learn with a robust set of capabilities including telemetry, help provider registration, and UI element rendering - all designed to enable better integrations and richer user experience.

What can you do with the UEF? The UEF is a set of Premium APIs that offers several new capabilities for integrations with the Blackboard Learn Ultra Experience.

**Telemetry:** Receiving of detailed user navigation behavior data, including click, route, and hoover events: [Here you may find a demo](https://youtu.be/rnMsvVo6xOA)

**User Interface Elements:** Ability to populate UI elements and content, including capabilities for banners, modals, and notifications.

**Help Provider Registration:** Option to override the default behavior of the native help tool in Ultra.

We gave several partners early access to the UEF. The following videos are examples of how these partners used the UEF to better deliver their integration in Ultra.
