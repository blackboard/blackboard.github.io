&lt;p&gt;First, as our documentation states, a Blackboard Learn admin should never be told to associate a user with Learn admin privileges with any REST API integration, see this document. Hence we often get questions from folks on how to create a user to associate with a REST API integration that has limited capability on a Learn system. One way is to research and design your REST application to use OAuth 2 3-legged Authentication. See the documents referenced below. 3LO guarentees that the user using your REST Application can only do what they can do via the Learn UX when they are logged into Learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if your application is using our OAuth 2 2-legged Authentication read on. Or I should say, watch on. I created the following to answer the question “Is it possible to create a user that has only the necessary permissions and avoid using “blackboard admin” user?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes! &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/uyKdbCpcZMc&quot;&gt;Here’s a video explaining exactly how to proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have spent some time over the holiday break updating and organizing our documentation better. One of the longest outstanding changes was to update the Caliper event samples from 1.0 to 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed this project. The &lt;a href=&quot;/standards/caliper/events/event-guide&quot;&gt;event guide&lt;/a&gt; is largely unchanged, but the individual events have all been updated to show current sample payloads from each event, allowing you to better anticipate the messages you will receive and better plan your storage and reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, we will be highlighting some of the other key updates that we hope will help ease the onboarding process for new developers and make finding exactly what you need when you need it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Scott Hurrey</name></author><category term="announcement" /><category term="standards" /><category term="caliper" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Caliper Documentation Updated for 1.1</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SOAP EOL Explained</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/12/16/SOAP-EOL-Explained.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SOAP EOL Explained" /><published>2020-12-16T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-12-16T12:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/12/16/SOAP-EOL-Explained</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/12/16/SOAP-EOL-Explained.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;soap-eol-explained&quot;&gt;SOAP EOL Explained&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, January 4, 2019 to be exact, Blackboard announced deprecation of our SOAP Web Services with this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://blackboard.secure.force.com/publickbarticleview?id=kA039000000Tm3cCAC&amp;amp;homepage=true&quot;&gt;Blackboard SOAP Web Services Deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost two years later in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes&quot;&gt;Learn SaaS Relase Notes&lt;/a&gt; we’ve written “As of December 31, 2020, Blackboard Learn SOAP Web Services are no longer supported, as they have reached the end of life per our deprecation policy.” What does this mean for you as a develoepr?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common concern is “Will my SOAP code continue to work in an earlier version of Blackboard Learn?” or some variation. Here’s a recent example: “Will this be for all versions, or will SOAP API still be available on version 3800?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that client’s self and manged-hosted systems that are on older versions of Learn will not be impacted. If your client is runnign 3800.0.3 and upgrades to the most recent Cumulative Update, the SOAP Webservices should continue to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For self and managed-hosted clients that are on 3900.0.0 and are now upgrading using the same build numbers as in SaaS, SOAP will not be supported in any release post Dec 31, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common quesiton is from those using the Blackboard Learn LIS 2.0 SIS integration, which is SOAP based. No, we are keeping the LIS 2.0 SIS integration in the product at this time. It will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have additional questions, drop a line to developers@blackboard.com and we’ll update this blog post with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy 2021!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Kauffman</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="soap" /><category term="learn" /><category term="eol" /><category term="api" /><summary type="html">SOAP EOL Explained</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cookies and Browsers</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/10/15/Cookies-and-Browsers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cookies and Browsers" /><published>2020-10-15T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-15T12:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/10/15/Cookies-and-Browsers</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/10/15/Cookies-and-Browsers.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;cookies-and-browsers&quot;&gt;Cookies and Browsers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people like cookies. Internet browsers used to like cookies, but a lot has changed in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing a lot of applications stop working in some browsers because cookies are not being shared, and this post hopes to help explain why that is happening and what can be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web application may set a cookie to track a user’s session. This is very common, however if your web application is going to be hosted in an iframe, then there’s a good chance your cookie won’t be sent back to you. This is because browsers are clamping down on sending “3rd-party” cookies back to applications hosted in an iframe. Note that a 3rd party is a site that is hosted on a domain different than the 1st party, or your web application. The reason is because these cookies can be used for tracking your internet and browsing activity. Safari has disallowed this for years as a user privacy measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case where cookies aren’t being sent back is during a form POST back to your application. If you set a cookie, then launch to a 3rd party application, if that application does a form POST back to you, the browser will likely not send your cookie back because it is trying to help prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than detail all the scenarios and work arounds here I link to two web pages that are immensely helpful in explaining the situation and some possible workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR is if you must set a cookie in your web application, be careful how you configure that cookie’s properties, and understand that at least in Safari, your cookies may not get passed back to you. The other browser makers are going to get as restrictive as Safari soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we launched two new sections of developer documentation - &lt;a href=&quot;/ally/getting-started&quot;&gt;Ally as a Service&lt;/a&gt; (AaaS) and the &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/uef/getting-started&quot;&gt;Learn Ultra Extension Framework&lt;/a&gt; (UEF). These new APIs give you access to integration points and functionality that allows you to bring the power of Blackboard into your applications, and ultimately, your user’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ally as a Service is a standalone, separately licensed API to apply specific components of Ally’s approach to content within your application. In its initial form, you are able to upload files, process them through Ally’s accessibility checklist, and retrieve data that tells you what can be improved. This is only the tip of the iceberg, so make sure you continue to monitor this amazing capability for enhancements moving forward. For more information, including a conversation about pricing, reach out to your Account Executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ultra Extension Framework Premium APIs allow an integration to subscribe to events happening real-time in the Ultra UI, and respond to those events by interacting directly with the UI to do things like open panels, display modals, show messages and notifications, and augment the help system in Learn. Partners will need to be at a bronze level or higher to access these Premium APIs. See the partnership team for more information. If you are not a partner, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/BECOME AN OFFICIAL BLACKBOARD PARTNER!.html&quot;&gt;how to become a partner&lt;/a&gt;. Licensed clients need only request access. Access is granted to your &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/rest/admin/groups-quats-rates&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; in the developer portal, much like rate limits. Just open a case on Behind the Blackboard to get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a href=&quot;/community/contact&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevCon 2020 is in the books, and what an amazing conference it was. This blog will start a weekly series in which everything Thursday, we will talk about DevCon from a content perspective. To begin this series, I want to set some context about the scope of this conference, so you, the reader, will have a baseline to base your opinions from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with some basic figures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client Registrations: 3,113​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Institutions: 1,276​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countries: 54​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Badges: 2,348​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;358 Unique attendees to live sessions​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2,352 Attendees to live sessions total​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;121,842 Collab session minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blackboarders: 300​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we really look at this, we can come up with some interesting insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we base our calculations on unique attendees to live sessions, we can see that the average attendee spent almost 6 hours actively engaged in sessions. We had 71 hours worth of sessions spread out over three separate time zones – Monday - Friday 8am-10am EDT, Monday - Friday 1pm-3pm EDT and on five days, 3pm to 4pm, and Monday-Thursday 8pm-10pm EDT – so the average attendee joining 6 sessions is pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also issued 6.6 badges per active attendee programmatically through Badgr. These badges included attending at least 75% of a collab session associated with a session, pathways, which awarded badges based on predetermined groups of session badges, interaction with Ally, and earning points and promotions in the leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of insights, let’s take a look at a few that show how users interacted with the content provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Attendance by Session and Region&quot; title=&quot;Attendance by Session and Region&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Registration by Country&quot; title=&quot;Registration by Country&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collaborate Minutes By Day&quot; title=&quot;Collaborate Minutes By Day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Recording Views and Downloads&quot; title=&quot;Recording Views and Downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final Leaderboard&quot; title=&quot;Final Leaderboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers and charts are cool, but what really matters from a DevCon perspective, is the experience of the attendees. Here are a few quotes that I think sum up the DevCon 2020 experience more that any statistic or chart can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“SUPER big high-five / cheers / shout-out and ALL the other superlatives out to @Scott Hurrey and all that helped make this 2020 DevCon !!!!  have greatly enjoyed it in this time of Social Distancing”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Kevin Squire, PA Virtual Charter School&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thanks @shurrey Scott for an awesome experience.. and thank you to all the presenters as well as participants. Look forward to continue networking and finding better solutions for students and faculty.”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Arokia Raj, INTI International Universities and Colleges, Malaysia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A big thank you to @shurrey and colleagues from @Blackboard for making the 2020 #DevCon a really special online experience. Spreading the event out over a fortnight gave participants a chance to practice and play, not just listen. Fun in dark times.”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Malcolm Murray, Durham&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, DevCon 2020 was a unique experience, and one that gave me a little bit of normalcy. Of course I would rather see everyone in person, but since I can’t, I was extremely happy we could have a virtual get-together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!
