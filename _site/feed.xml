&lt;p&gt;We have spent some time over the holiday break updating and organizing our documentation better. One of the longest outstanding changes was to update the Caliper event samples from 1.0 to 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed this project. The &lt;a href=&quot;/standards/caliper/events/event-guide&quot;&gt;event guide&lt;/a&gt; is largely unchanged, but the individual events have all been updated to show current sample payloads from each event, allowing you to better anticipate the messages you will receive and better plan your storage and reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, we will be highlighting some of the other key updates that we hope will help ease the onboarding process for new developers and make finding exactly what you need when you need it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, January 4, 2019 to be exact, Blackboard announced deprecation of our SOAP Web Services with this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://blackboard.secure.force.com/publickbarticleview?id=kA039000000Tm3cCAC&amp;amp;homepage=true&quot;&gt;Blackboard SOAP Web Services Deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost two years later in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes&quot;&gt;Learn SaaS Relase Notes&lt;/a&gt; we’ve written “As of December 31, 2020, Blackboard Learn SOAP Web Services are no longer supported, as they have reached the end of life per our deprecation policy.” What does this mean for you as a develoepr?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common concern is “Will my SOAP code continue to work in an earlier version of Blackboard Learn?” or some variation. Here’s a recent example: “Will this be for all versions, or will SOAP API still be available on version 3800?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that client’s self and manged-hosted systems that are on older versions of Learn will not be impacted. If your client is runnign 3800.0.3 and upgrades to the most recent Cumulative Update, the SOAP Webservices should continue to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For self and managed-hosted clients that are on 3900.0.0 and are now upgrading using the same build numbers as in SaaS, SOAP will not be supported in any release post Dec 31, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common quesiton is from those using the Blackboard Learn LIS 2.0 SIS integration, which is SOAP based. No, we are keeping the LIS 2.0 SIS integration in the product at this time. It will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have additional questions, drop a line to developers@blackboard.com and we’ll update this blog post with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people like cookies. Internet browsers used to like cookies, but a lot has changed in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing a lot of applications stop working in some browsers because cookies are not being shared, and this post hopes to help explain why that is happening and what can be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web application may set a cookie to track a user’s session. This is very common, however if your web application is going to be hosted in an iframe, then there’s a good chance your cookie won’t be sent back to you. This is because browsers are clamping down on sending “3rd-party” cookies back to applications hosted in an iframe. Note that a 3rd party is a site that is hosted on a domain different than the 1st party, or your web application. The reason is because these cookies can be used for tracking your internet and browsing activity. Safari has disallowed this for years as a user privacy measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case where cookies aren’t being sent back is during a form POST back to your application. If you set a cookie, then launch to a 3rd party application, if that application does a form POST back to you, the browser will likely not send your cookie back because it is trying to help prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than detail all the scenarios and work arounds here I link to two web pages that are immensely helpful in explaining the situation and some possible workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR is if you must set a cookie in your web application, be careful how you configure that cookie’s properties, and understand that at least in Safari, your cookies may not get passed back to you. The other browser makers are going to get as restrictive as Safari soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we launched two new sections of developer documentation - &lt;a href=&quot;/ally/getting-started&quot;&gt;Ally as a Service&lt;/a&gt; (AaaS) and the &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/uef/getting-started&quot;&gt;Learn Ultra Extension Framework&lt;/a&gt; (UEF). These new APIs give you access to integration points and functionality that allows you to bring the power of Blackboard into your applications, and ultimately, your user’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ally as a Service is a standalone, separately licensed API to apply specific components of Ally’s approach to content within your application. In its initial form, you are able to upload files, process them through Ally’s accessibility checklist, and retrieve data that tells you what can be improved. This is only the tip of the iceberg, so make sure you continue to monitor this amazing capability for enhancements moving forward. For more information, including a conversation about pricing, reach out to your Account Executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ultra Extension Framework Premium APIs allow an integration to subscribe to events happening real-time in the Ultra UI, and respond to those events by interacting directly with the UI to do things like open panels, display modals, show messages and notifications, and augment the help system in Learn. Partners will need to be at a bronze level or higher to access these Premium APIs. See the partnership team for more information. If you are not a partner, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/BECOME AN OFFICIAL BLACKBOARD PARTNER!.html&quot;&gt;how to become a partner&lt;/a&gt;. Licensed clients need only request access. Access is granted to your &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/rest/admin/groups-quats-rates&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; in the developer portal, much like rate limits. Just open a case on Behind the Blackboard to get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevCon 2020 is in the books, and what an amazing conference it was. This blog will start a weekly series in which everything Thursday, we will talk about DevCon from a content perspective. To begin this series, I want to set some context about the scope of this conference, so you, the reader, will have a baseline to base your opinions from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with some basic figures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client Registrations: 3,113​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Institutions: 1,276​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countries: 54​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Badges: 2,348​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;358 Unique attendees to live sessions​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2,352 Attendees to live sessions total​&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;121,842 Collab session minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blackboarders: 300​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we really look at this, we can come up with some interesting insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we base our calculations on unique attendees to live sessions, we can see that the average attendee spent almost 6 hours actively engaged in sessions. We had 71 hours worth of sessions spread out over three separate time zones – Monday - Friday 8am-10am EDT, Monday - Friday 1pm-3pm EDT and on five days, 3pm to 4pm, and Monday-Thursday 8pm-10pm EDT – so the average attendee joining 6 sessions is pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also issued 6.6 badges per active attendee programmatically through Badgr. These badges included attending at least 75% of a collab session associated with a session, pathways, which awarded badges based on predetermined groups of session badges, interaction with Ally, and earning points and promotions in the leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of insights, let’s take a look at a few that show how users interacted with the content provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Attendance by Session and Region&quot; title=&quot;Attendance by Session and Region&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Registration by Country&quot; title=&quot;Registration by Country&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collaborate Minutes By Day&quot; title=&quot;Collaborate Minutes By Day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Recording Views and Downloads&quot; title=&quot;Recording Views and Downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final Leaderboard&quot; title=&quot;Final Leaderboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers and charts are cool, but what really matters from a DevCon perspective, is the experience of the attendees. Here are a few quotes that I think sum up the DevCon 2020 experience more that any statistic or chart can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“SUPER big high-five / cheers / shout-out and ALL the other superlatives out to @Scott Hurrey and all that helped make this 2020 DevCon !!!!  have greatly enjoyed it in this time of Social Distancing”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Kevin Squire, PA Virtual Charter School&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thanks @shurrey Scott for an awesome experience.. and thank you to all the presenters as well as participants. Look forward to continue networking and finding better solutions for students and faculty.”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Arokia Raj, INTI International Universities and Colleges, Malaysia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A big thank you to @shurrey and colleagues from @Blackboard for making the 2020 #DevCon a really special online experience. Spreading the event out over a fortnight gave participants a chance to practice and play, not just listen. Fun in dark times.”​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Malcolm Murray, Durham&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, DevCon 2020 was a unique experience, and one that gave me a little bit of normalcy. Of course I would rather see everyone in person, but since I can’t, I was extremely happy we could have a virtual get-together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!

&lt;p&gt;DevCon 2020 kicked off in full force this week with clients, partners and Blackboarders around the world coming together in Blackboard Learn Ultra to network, share knowledge, and dig deeper into Blackboard tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a record number of people at DevCon with 2,273 attendees logging in from 973 institutions and 43 countries throughout the week. We also had some amazing content, delivered all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our most-attended session was ‘Collaborate Best Practices’ presented by Amy Eyre from the University of York and Helga Gunnarsdottir from the University of the West of England (UWE), co-chairs of the EMEA Mobile and Collaborate User Group, affectionately known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.blackboard.com/groups/home/57&quot;&gt;MoCo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights include the ‘May the Data be with you’ series. I definitly miss seeing everyone in person, so the lively interaction in these sessions led by a talented group of System Administrators was definitely the next best thing. Big thanks to Casey Eubank from WSU Tech, Chris Bray from Arkansas, Heather Crites from Columbia State Community College, Dan Gioia from St. Louis Community College, Bradley Lawton from Louisville, and Mark Reynolds from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of other sessions that were well-attended and extremely interesting, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘LTI Advantage for System Administrators’&lt;/strong&gt;, a thorough overview from Blackboard’s own Eric Preston of the history of LTI, the new LTI Advantage spec, and everything a system administrator needs to know about LTI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘A Galaxy of Learn Data - Blast off with BbData &amp;amp; Python!’&lt;/strong&gt; was a look at the amazing work that Mike Bechtel from Indian River State College has done using Python to interact with Blackboard Data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Turning any resource into an LTI tool to optimize Base Navigation’&lt;/strong&gt; from University of Chicago’s Szymon Machajewski was an entertaining look at a simple tool that turns any URL into an LTI tool that can be embedded into any LTI-compliant platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could list highlights of all of the sessions, but in the spirit of brevity, let me just say thank you. Thank you to all of our presenters for taking the time out of your busy schedule – sometimes crazy early, crazy late, or both – to share your knowledge with the rest of our community. There is no better way to support and learn from each other than open communication. I look forward to building on this virtual DevCon to continue that global communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, we’ll continue running sessions three times each day to accommodate all time zones and schedules. Here are some sessions you won’t want to miss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget about Hackboard: Data. This weeklong event will allow attendees to build meaningful insights against the wealth of information Blackboard Data puts at your fingertips. We’ll kick off Monday and finish on Friday, with two Q&amp;amp;A sessions in between. So add the Hackboard: Data session to your schedule and join us for the kickoff on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, it looks like Mark Reynolds is atop the leaderboard, with Bradley Lawton and Eric Silva fast on his heels. And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention our badging with Badgr. So far (not including Friday), we have awarded 480 badges, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arokia Raj, INTI Internation University and Colleges in Malaysia, who earned the ‘Daily Champions Champion’ badge by earning all of the Daily Champion badges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark Carroll, Mark Reynolds, and Kevin Lowey who earned the ‘Let’s take it data day’ badge, by attending 4 of the 8 data-based (see what I did there?) sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark Carroll, Alicia Dunlap, Irene Rojas, and Elizabeth Barcena, who have attended more than half of the LTI sessions, earning them the ‘LTI Advantageous’ badge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to see all who attended and more back on Monday as we get ready for another week of great content from our clients (and us, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know, I can’t let the chance to write some code poetry pass by:&lt;/p&gt;
