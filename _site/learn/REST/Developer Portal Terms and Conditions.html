<p><strong>BLACKBOARD® REST DEVELOPER AGREEMENT</strong></p>

<p>This Blackboard REST Developer Agreement (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”) enables the
development and testing of software applications designed to interoperate with
designated Blackboard applications.</p>

<p>By clicking “I agree” or otherwise indicating your agreement as part of an
online process, the terms contained in this Agreement form the entire
agreement between the Developer and Blackboard Inc. (“Blackboard”) with
respect to: (a) the development of Developer Applications through the use of
Blackboard’s REST APIs and Documentation; and (b) the use of a DVBA to test
the interoperability of the Developer Applications therewith. You represent
that you have the authority to bind the Developer to the terms of this
Agreement and that you and Developer will comply with the terms and conditions
hereof. All rights and privileges granted under this Agreement are contingent
upon Developer’s agreement to the terms and conditions hereof.</p>

<p>**1. DEFINITIONS. **</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. **“APIs”** means Blackboard’s REST-based application program interfaces which are made available by Blackboard to facilitate the development of Developer Applications, as such APIs may (without obligation) be updated by Blackboard from time to time.
2. **“Blackboard Application”** means a software solution of Blackboard that can be made interoperable with Developer Applications through the use of the APIs and Documentation. A Blackboard Application also includes: (a) any associated product documentation or materials that Blackboard may, in its sole discretion, provide; and (b) any Upgrades.
3. **“Developer” **means the individual or company or other legal entity on whose behalf you enter into this Agreement and which intends to develop Developer Applications in accordance herewith.
4. **“Developer Application” **means a software application created by Developer that is intended to use the APIs. In no event shall a Developer Application include any intellectual property from a DVBA.
5. **“Developer Version of a Blackboard Application” or “DVBA” **means a version of a Blackboard Application which contains quotas, rate limits, bandwidth limits and/or other usage or technical limits which are designed to limit Developer’s use of the Blackboard Application for non-production testing purposes only. 
6. **“Documentation”** means Blackboard’s REST Developer user guides, sample code and related materials which are made available to Developers, as such Documentation may (without obligation) be updated from time to time by Blackboard.
7. **“Portal” **means the area of the Blackboard corporate website from which Developers can obtain rights of use to the APIs, Documentation and DVBA for the purposes described hereunder.
8. **“Term” **shall have the meaning prescribed in Section 7 below.
9. **“Upgrade”** means the object code versions of a DVBA that has been enhanced or otherwise modified by or on behalf of Blackboard, acting in its sole discretion, to include additional functionality or code changes. Blackboard shall determine, in its sole discretion and without obligation, whether to develop or make available any Upgrades for use by Developer.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. REGISTRATION</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. In order to be provided access to the APIs, Documentation, and a DVBA, Developer is required to register with Blackboard by providing certain information as directed in the Portal. Registration information shall include, without limitation, Developer’s contact information, a password and related login information for accessing Developer’s account, information identifying and describing the Developer Application, and such other information as may be requested by Blackboard. Developer agrees to provide all requested registration information and covenants that such information shall be accurate and kept up to date. 
2. Upon acceptance of Developer’s registration, Blackboard will provide Developer with certain keys and/or passwords which may be used by Developer in order to access and use the APIs, Documentation, and DVBAs, which access and use shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
3. Developer’s registration with Blackboard, and the associated provision of access by Blackboard to the APIS, Documentation and DVBAs, shall in no event be deemed to be, or promoted by Developer as, an endorsement or certification by Blackboard of the Developer or of the compatibility or operation of any Developer Application. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. USE OF THE APIS, DOCUMENTATION AND DVBAS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the Term hereof, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the APIs and Documentation for the sole purpose of developing Developer Applications which are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications. 
2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent Blackboard makes available to Developer a DVBA which is downloadable to a device in Developer’s computing environment, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download and install a single, object-code copy of the DVBA, but: (a) for use only as a component of the Developer’s non-production development environment; and (b) solely for the purpose of testing the interoperability of the Developer Application with a DVBA in such non-production development environment by making requests from the Developer Application, in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to enable the exchange of data between the applications.
3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent that Blackboard makes available to Developer a Blackboard-hosted Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) version of a DVBA, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access the DVBA on a remote access basis over the Internet solely for the purpose of testing the interoperability of the Developer Application with the DVBA in a non-production development environment by making requests from the Developer Application, in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to enable the exchange of data between the applications. 
4. The DVBA will include usage and other limitations in order to ensure that Developer makes use of such Blackboard Application only for development and testing purposes. In this regard, unless stated otherwise on the Portal, Developer shall be limited to use of the DVBA for no more than 150 users, 100 courses and 1,000 enrollment records. In addition, Developer shall be provided with “testing level” usage limits (such as quotas, bandwidth limits and/or rate limits) in connection with its use of the DVBAs. Such limitations will be as designated or applied by Blackboard in its sole discretion. Additional usage, technical, licensing or other limitations may be applied by Blackboard in its sole discretion. Developer is solely responsible for testing the Developer Application, for determining whether it is interoperable with a DVBA and thus a Blackboard Application, and for abiding by all applicable limitations and restrictions.
5. Developer may promote and market a Developer Application to potential customers by using the Blackboard logo and applicable Blackboard trademarks, but only to state that the Developer Applications are “designed for Blackboard” or to make such other similar statements which are approved in advance in writing by Blackboard and which indicate that the Developer Applications are designed to be compatible with the applicable Blackboard Applications. Notwithstanding the above, Developer shall make no representation indicating that Blackboard endorses, supports or makes any commitment regarding the interoperability of the Developer Application with any Blackboard Application. Developer may not use the name “Blackboard” or any other trademark of Blackboard in the name of any of its Developer Applications. Developer shall comply with Blackboard’s trademark policies. Blackboard may require Developer to discontinue use of Blackboard trademarks upon written notice. Developer understands and agrees that it is solely responsible and liable for its promotion and marketing activities and that it may not operate, distribute, or deploy a Developer Application, including to interact with a Blackboard Application other than a DVBA, to a customer unless and until it enters into the separate agreement described in Section 6 below.
6. Developer shall only use the APIs and Documentation in accordance with the associated Blackboard guidance and instructions described therein or on the Portal. Developer shall only access the DVBAs for the limited purposes described herein and in accordance with any documentation or materials made available by Blackboard with respect to the use or operation thereof.
7. Except as expressly permitted in the Agreement, Developer may not: (a) disclose, distribute (including by uploading to web sites, electronic bulletin boards or on or through any other method or media), display, sublicense, sell, or transfer any rights in the APIs, the Documentation or any DVBA (collectively, the “Blackboard Property”), in whole or in part, to any third party; (b) use the Blackboard Property, in whole or in part, for service bureau or outsourcing use or otherwise for the use or benefit of any third party; (c) exceed applicable usage, technical, licensing or other limitations which are set forth in this Agreement, in any materials or documentation provided by Blackboard or as may be separately imposed by Blackboard; (d) copy, modify, alter, or create derivative works of, or otherwise use for any purpose other than the purpose expressly authorized hereunder, the Blackboard Property; (e) use the Blackboard Property to create any product or service similar to any Blackboard Property or Blackboard Application, or otherwise exploit or commercialize the Blackboard Property; (f) gain or seek to gain access to any DVBA or Blackboard Application other than through the APIs as contemplated herein; (g) reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt or decompile the APIs or any DVBA or Blackboard Application, or otherwise make any attempt to access or discover the source code thereof, or interfere with or disrupt the APIs, DVBAs, or Blackboard Applications or any servers or networks through which they are provided; (h) permit any third party to access or use the Blackboard Property, or to resell, distribute or otherwise use or exercise any rights with respect thereto;  disable any “auto reporting option” or similar reporting capability in any DVBA; or (j) provide any services or support to any third party regarding, or in connection with, any Blackboard Property.
8. A DVBA may utilize or include third party software or content (“Third Party Software”). To the extent necessary to use the applicable DVBA, Blackboard grants Developer a license to use such Third Party Software solely on the same terms and conditions (including all limitations and restrictions) as Developer is authorized to use the DVBA hereunder. However, Blackboard reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue Developer’s rights of use in Third Party Software to the extent required by an applicable third party licensor or supplier or the terms of Blackboard’s agreement therewith.
9. Blackboard may determine, in its sole discretion and without obligation, whether to make available any DVBA, and associated APIs and Documentation, for the purposes contemplated hereunder.
10. All rights not expressly granted to Developer are reserved by Blackboard.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4. BLACKBOARD OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Blackboard will provide Developer with: (a) access to the APIs and Documentation; and (b) access to the DVBA(s), in each case for Developer’s use in connection with the development of Developer Applications as contemplated hereunder. 
2. From time to time, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, Blackboard may elect to provide certain limited technical support to Developers. Any such support shall be as described in the relevant “Developer Support” or similar areas of the Portal, and may be modified, reduced, cancelled or updated at any time upon written notice provided by Blackboard in the Portal or otherwise. Any and all support will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal, and may require payment of fees as described therein. Blackboard may also make support available separately through other programs or offerings from time, and such support would be subject to the separate terms and conditions associated therewith. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>5. DEVELOPER’S OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Developer shall develop each Developer Application in compliance with the then-current version of the APIs and Documentation and, accordingly, shall ensure that each Developer Application enables and maintains interoperability with the applicable DVBA and Blackboard Application.
2. Developer shall be solely responsible for each Developer Application, including all support, development, hosting, and maintenance thereof and its interoperability with any Blackboard Application. Accordingly, Developer shall be solely responsible and liable (including to its customers and other parties) for all matters regarding the Developer Applications, including their development, operation, performance, availability, interoperability, support, and hosting.
3. Developer shall use security best practices in connection with the development of the Developer Application and will comply at all times with all applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations and all security requirements of Blackboard made available on the Portal or otherwise. Developer will implement security measures adequate to preserve the confidentiality and security of all data which is processed, stored, transmitted or handled by Developer or any Developer Application.
4. Developer grants Blackboard the right to copy, display and otherwise use the registration information and materials provided by Developer for the purposes contemplated in the Agreement. In addition, Blackboard shall have the right (but not the obligation) to use the registration information provided by Developer in order to contact Developer to inquire as to Developer’s interest in discussing a partner relationship with Blackboard (including, by way of example and at Blackboard’s sole discretion, a relationship under which Developer may be granted deployment rights as described in Section 6 below). Neither party would have any obligations in connection with any such partner relationship unless and until the parties enter into a separate agreement (or an amendment hereto) which documents the terms and conditions of the relationship. In addition, Developer grants Blackboard the right to use Developer’s name, logo and applicable trademarks, in promotional materials and otherwise in order to promote, market and/or otherwise identify Developer as a registered developer of REST applications which are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications. 
5. Developer shall not share or expose the Developer Application Key/Secret pair. Application Key/Secret pairs shall only be held in the Developer Application code. Similarly the Developer Application must never expose the Developer Application OAuth Token. Exposing the Developer Application Key/Secret pair, or the OAuth Token will create a serious security risk. If Developer believes he/she has exposed an Application Key/Secret pair the Developer may request a new pair for the Developer Application using the Developer Portal My Applications management page. Blackboard shall in no way be responsible for lost or exposed data resulting from unapproved or inappropriate use of REST Application Key/Secret pairs or OAuth Tokens.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>6. DISTRIBUTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. The purpose of this Agreement is to enable Developer to gain access to the APIs, Documentation and DVBA(s) in order to develop Developer Applications and conduct non-production testing of the interoperability of such Developer Applications with the associated Blackboard Application(s). Developer is not authorized under this Agreement to, and warrants that it shall not: (a) operate, deploy, or distribute a Developer Application for access or use by Developer’s customers or any third party, or (b) use the APIs other than to facilitate interaction of a Developer Application with the applicable DVBAs. In order to so operate, deploy, or distribute any Developer Application, Developer will be required to first enter into a separate agreement with Blackboard which would, among other terms and conditions, require:  registration of each Developer Application; (ii) the purchase of appropriate “production-level” usage limits (such as quotas, bandwidth limits and/or rate limits); and/or (iii) the purchase of an appropriate level of membership in the “Blackboard Developer Network” or similar program. Information regarding the process for entering into such agreement shall be made available by Blackboard on the Portal or otherwise. Developer acknowledges that its expenditure of time and money in developing Developer Applications is at its own risk and Blackboard makes no guarantees with regard to the availability of Blackboard Applications. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>7. TERM AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
