# Security and Tokens

Blackboard Collaborate relies on JSON web tokens ([JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"}) to authenticate and authorize incoming REST API calls. A JSON web token can be signed with either RSA or HMAC. RSA allows the REST Client to sign the JWT with public and private keys via x.509 certificates. HMAC allows the JWT to be signed with a shared secret. Either way, the data can be trusted because it's digitally signed with mutually known credentials.

[Here's a sample Python script](https://github.com/ryanhaber/Blackboard-REST-SDK-python/blob/master/bb-collab-simple-sample-get-users.py){:target="_blank"} that uses a correctly formed JWT assertion to request an access token and then uses the access token to make a single API request.

### JWT Assertion
To get API access to Blackboard Collaborate, you must create a JWT assertion. A JWT assertion is a JSON web token request for access. It includes:

- header
- payload
- signature

The header and payload are each base64 encoded and the three parts are separated with a dot, resulting in a token in this format:

~~~ jsonnet
encodedheader.encodedpayload.signature
~~~

and resembles the following:

~~~ yaml
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJteS1jb2xsYWItcmVzdC1r
ZXkiLCJzdWIiOiJteS1jb2xsYWItcmVzdC1rZXkiLCJleHAiOiIxNDgwNDU3NzYzOTg4I

~~~

### JWT Header

The header is a JSON object with that identifies the algorithm used to generate the signature and the type of token being created. In this example, the application is signing the data with HMAC-SHA 256 and requesting a JSON Web Token.

~~~ json
    {  
       "alg": "HS256",  
       "typ": "JWT"   
    }
~~~

To create the encodedheader part of the token, base64 encode this JSON.

### JWT Payload
The payload contains information about the calling application that uniquely identifies the client to the REST server. Blackboard Collaborate REST APIs require these pieces of information:

- The issuer of the request, which is the Collaborate REST API key.
- The subject of the request, which must be the same as the issuer.
- Expiration time of the assertion, expressed in UNIX epoch time, within 5 minutes of the time of the request.

For example:

~~~ json
    {  
       "iss": "my-collab-rest-key",  
       "sub": "my-collab-rest-key",  
       "exp": "1480457763988"   
    }
~~~

Base64 encode the payload and append it to the based64-encoded header, separated by a dot.

### JWT Signature

The signature is basically the string created above (encodedheader.encodedpayload), signed using the algorithm specified in the header and the REST API secret provided by Blackboard. The resulting string must be appended to encodedheader.encodedpayload, separated with a dot.

### Building a JWT Request

To request an access, you must make a POST request to the Collaborate API /token endpoint, like the following:
~~~ yaml
    POST /token?grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn
    R5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJteS1jb2xsYWItcmVzdC1rZXkiLCJzdWIiOiJteS1jb2xsYWItcmVzdC1rZXkiLCJleHAiOiIx
    NDgwNDU3NzYzOTg4In0.7eElTSzDRfWaQlKeVaMDJlN0-_7dmNq7nRP82pm47kY
~~~

Also note:

- Include a grant_type parameter. The grant_type must always be set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer in Collaborate requests. 
- The grant_type and the assertion should be sent in the body of the request.
- Include a header for content-Type which is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

### Using the JWT Token
A properly formed POST to /token returns an access token. To authorize a request to Collaborate, add this access token as a Bear token in your requestâ€™s authorization header. The authorization header will look like the following.

~~~ yaml
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODAzNzM2ODEsInN1YiI6ImJiQ29sbGFiQXBpIiwiaXNzIj
    oiYmJDb2xsYWJBcGkiLCJ0eXBlIjoxLCJjb25zdW1lciI6IjkxRjA1RENEODhGQzQzRkMwMUY0NjI5MDEwQzNFQjc3IiwiaWF0Ijo

### Additional Resources
JSON Web Tokens are a widely adopted standard in modern applications, and thus, there are a ton of resources available for developers interested in JWT beyond the scope of Blackboard Collaborate.

- [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/){:target="_blank"}: a site dedicated to assisting developers trying to build JWT-enabled applications. There is a debugger that allows you to manually input your secret and your header and payload and generate an assertion. There is also an extensive list of available libraries in multiple languages that handle the bulk of the JWT creation.

- [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"}: the actual standard specification document.
