# Overview

Learning Tool Interoperability is a standard from the IMS Global consortium.
This standard focuses on contextual launches and grade return. For more
information about the standard, see [Learning Tools
Interoperability](https://community.blackboard.com/external-

# Make Your LTI Tool Available to Learn Servers

Once you have developed an LTI tool, you can share it with Learn
administrators so that they can configure their Learn servers to work with it.
To share your tool, you must register your application. When you do so, you
receive an Application ID. Share this Application ID with the administrator of
any Learn server that will use your LTI tool. For more information about
registering your application, see[Register Your
Application](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-4566-register-your-
application).
