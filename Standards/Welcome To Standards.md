This is space for the community to make contributions around working with
educational technology standards. We are especially interested in standards
put forth by [IMS Global](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=https%3A//www.imsglobal.org/) and [Advanced Distributed
Learning (ADL)](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
link.jspa?url=https%3A//www.adlnet.gov/adl-research/scorm/).

Any member of the community can contribute documentation. We do not intend to
document specification completely but rather to demonstrate and document
experiences of integrating with Blackboard using these standards.
