The Blackboard Developer Community, home of the Blackboard Developers Network
(BbDN), is designed to provide you with key information and services about
developing and deploying Building Blocks for the Blackboard Learn platform.
Building Blocks are plug-in technologies that integrate your Blackboard
learning platform with external applications, content, or services. They can
include portal modules, content, specific tools and assessment engines to name
just a few. These technologies can link Blackboard with external systems,
applications, or services, or can be applications that run entirely within the
Blackboard environment.

Many Building Blocks already exist. There are two primary sources that you can
search to find both free/open source and commercially-supported plugins for
your Blackboard learning platform:

  * [Blackboard Building Blocks Catalog  
](https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bla
ckboard.com%2FCommunities%2FPartners%2FBuilding-Blocks.aspx)

  * [OSCELOT Projects Site](https://community.blackboard.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.oscelot.org%2F)

As a member of the Developer Community, you also have access to technical
documentation and other resources to help you build your own plug-ins
including:

  * Complete documentation
  * Online forums and user groups
  * Code snippets and sample code
  * Tutorials and other technical documentation
  * One Blackboard Developer Edition license
  * Developer Virtual Machine

Additional developer accounts can be created for members of your institution
by having your institution's primary contact or designated System
Administrator send the name, e-mail address, and title of additional
developers to [developers@blackboard.com](mailto:developers@blackboard.com).
