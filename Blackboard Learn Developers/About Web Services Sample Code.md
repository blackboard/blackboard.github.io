Blackboard Learn provides access to sample code to help Developers build
against the Blackboard Web Services. This sample code is accessible directly
from the Blackboard Learn User Interface. The download comes in the form of a
zip archive and contains a number of build-able projects. These projects can
be re-used in conjunction with the license contained in the root directory of
the zip archive.

## How To Get It

Any user with access to the Web Services section of the System Administrator
panel can download the Web Services Sample Code and Javadoc-based Web Services
API documentation.

Services client.

LICENSE_for_samples.txt

sample_webservice

The Blackboard Web Services contain a number of the most popular integration
points available in the Building Block framework, but not all. As a result,
Blackboard Learn allows for the inclusion of custom web services to be created
and added into the existing Web Services framework. A sample “hello world” web
service is included in this package.

b2client

A sample Building Block that utilizes the web services directly in the Java
Virtual Machine, bypassing the SOAP Layer.
