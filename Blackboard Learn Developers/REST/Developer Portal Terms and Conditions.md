**3.	USE OF THE APIS, DOCUMENTATION AND DVBAS**

3.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the Term hereof, 
Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and 
use the APIs and Documentation for the sole purpose of developing Developer Applications 
which are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications.

3.2.	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent Blackboard 
makes available to Developer a DVBA which is downloadable to a device in Developer’s 
computing environment, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
limited license to download and install a single, object-code copy of the DVBA, but solely for the 
following purposes: (a) for use only as a component of the Developer’s non-production 
development environment;  (b)  to test the interoperability of the Developer Application with a 
DVBA in such non-production development environment by making requests from the 
Developer Application, in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to 
enable the exchange of data between the applications; (c) to test the interoperability of an 
Developer Application with a DVBA in such non-production development environment through 
the utilization of the LTI Specification; and (d) to conduct demonstrations of the Developer 
Application to prospective customers in a non-production, Developer-controlled environment 
for evaluation purposes only.

3.3.	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if and to the extent that 
Blackboard makes available to Developer a Blackboard-hosted Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) 
version of a DVBA, Blackboard grants to Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited 
license to access the DVBA on a remote access basis over the Internet solely for the following 
purposes:  (a) to  test the interoperability of the Developer Application with the DVBA in its 
non-production development environment by making requests from the Developer Application, 
in accordance with the APIs and Documentation, which are designed to enable the exchange of 
data between the applications; (b) to test the interoperability of an Developer Application with 
a DVBA in its non-production development environment through the utilization of the LTI 
Specification; and (c) to conduct demonstrations of the Developer Application to prospective 
customers in a non-production, Developer-controlled environment for evaluation purposes 
only.

3.4.	The DVBA will include usage and other limitations in order to ensure that Developer 
makes use of such Blackboard Application only for development, testing and demonstration 
purposes described above.  In this regard, unless stated otherwise on the Portal, Developer 
shall be limited to use of the DVBA for no more than 150 users, 100 courses and 1,000 
enrollment records.  In addition, Developer shall be provided with “testing level” usage limits 
(such as quotas, bandwidth limits and/or rate limits) in connection with its use of the DVBAs.   
Such limitations will be as designated or applied by Blackboard in its sole discretion.  Additional 
usage, technical, licensing or other limitations may be applied by Blackboard in its sole 
discretion.  Developer is solely responsible for testing the Developer Application, for 
determining whether it is interoperable with a DVBA and thus a Blackboard Application, and for 
abiding by all applicable limitations and restrictions. To the extent Developer utilizes the LTI 
Specification, it is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary rights to use such LTI 
Specification for the purposes contemplated hereunder.

3.5.	Developer may promote and market a Developer Application to potential customers by 
using the Blackboard logo and applicable Blackboard trademarks, but only to state that the 
Developer Applications are “designed for Blackboard” or to make such other similar statements 
which are approved in advance in writing by Blackboard and which indicate that the Developer 
Applications are designed to be compatible with the applicable Blackboard Applications.  
Notwithstanding the above, Developer shall make no representation indicating that Blackboard 
endorses, supports or makes any commitment regarding the interoperability of the Developer 
Application with any Blackboard Application.   Developer may not use the name “Blackboard” 
or any other trademark of Blackboard in the name of any of its Developer Applications. 
Developer shall comply with Blackboard’s trademark policies.  Blackboard may require 
Developer to discontinue use of Blackboard trademarks upon written notice.  Developer 
understands and agrees that it is solely responsible and liable for its promotion and marketing 
activities and that it may not operate, distribute, or deploy a Developer Application, including 
to interact with a Blackboard Application other than a DVBA, to a customer unless and until it 
enters into the separate agreement described in Section 6 below.

3.6.	Developer shall only use the APIs and Documentation in accordance with the associated 
Blackboard guidance and instructions described therein or on the Portal.  Developer shall only 
access the DVBAs for the limited purposes described herein and in accordance with any 
documentation or materials made available by Blackboard with respect to the use or operation 
thereof.

3.7.	Except as expressly permitted in the Agreement, Developer may not: (a) disclose, 
distribute (including by uploading to web sites, electronic bulletin boards or on or through any 
other method or media), display, sublicense, sell, or transfer any rights in the APIs, the 
Documentation or any DVBA (collectively, the “Blackboard Property”), in whole or in part, to 
any third party; (b) use the Blackboard Property, in whole or in part, for service bureau or 
outsourcing use or otherwise for the use or benefit of any third party; (c) exceed applicable 
usage, technical, licensing or other limitations which are set forth in this Agreement, in any 
materials or documentation provided by Blackboard or as may be separately imposed by 
Blackboard; (d) copy, modify, alter, or create derivative works of, or otherwise use for any 
purpose other than the purpose expressly authorized hereunder, the Blackboard Property;  (e) 
use the Blackboard Property to create any product or service similar to any Blackboard Property 
or Blackboard Application, or otherwise exploit or commercialize the Blackboard Property;  (f) 
gain or seek to gain access to any DVBA or Blackboard Application other than through the APIs 
as contemplated herein; (g) reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt or decompile the APIs or 
any DVBA or Blackboard Application, or otherwise make any attempt to access or discover the 
source code thereof, or interfere with or disrupt the APIs, DVBAs, or Blackboard Applications or 
any servers or networks through which they are provided; (h) permit any third party to access 
or use the Blackboard Property, or to resell, distribute or otherwise use or exercise any rights 
with respect thereto; (i) disable any “auto reporting option” or similar reporting capability in 
any DVBA; or (j) provide any services or support to any third party regarding, or in connection 
with, any Blackboard Property.

3.8.	A DVBA may utilize or include third party software or content (“Third Party Software”).  
To the extent necessary to use the applicable DVBA, Blackboard grants Developer a license to 
use such Third Party Software solely on the same terms and conditions (including all limitations 
and restrictions) as Developer is authorized to use the DVBA hereunder.  However, Blackboard 
reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue Developer’s rights of use in Third Party 
Software to the extent required by an applicable third party licensor or supplier or the terms of 
Blackboard’s agreement therewith.

3.9.	Blackboard may determine, in its sole discretion and without obligation, whether to 
make available any DVBA, and associated APIs and Documentation, for the purposes 
contemplated hereunder.

3.10.	All rights not expressly granted to Developer are reserved by Blackboard.

**4.	BLACKBOARD OBLIGATIONS**

4.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Blackboard will provide 
Developer with: (a) access to the APIs and Documentation; and (b) access to the DVBA(s), in 
each case for Developer’s use in connection with the development of Developer Applications as 
contemplated hereunder.

4.2.	From time to time, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, Blackboard may 
elect to provide certain limited technical support to Developers.  Any such support shall be as 
described in the relevant “Developer Support” or similar areas of the Portal, and may be in the 
form of self-service support.  Any such support may be modified, reduced, cancelled or updated 
at any time upon written notice provided by Blackboard in the Portal or otherwise.  Any and all 
support will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal, and may require 
payment of fees as described therein.  Blackboard may also make support available separately 
through other programs or offerings from time, and such support would be subject to the 
separate terms and conditions associated therewith.

**5.	DEVELOPER’S OBLIGATIONS**

5.1.	Developer shall develop each Developer Application in compliance with the then-
current version of the APIs and Documentation and, accordingly, shall ensure that each 
Developer Application enables and maintains interoperability with the applicable DVBA and 
Blackboard Application.

5.2.	Developer shall be solely responsible for each Developer Application, including all 
support, development, hosting, and maintenance thereof and its interoperability with any 
Blackboard Application.  Accordingly, Developer shall be solely responsible and liable (including 
to its customers and other parties) for all matters regarding the Developer Applications, 
including their development, operation, performance, availability, interoperability, support, and 
hosting.

5.3.	Developer shall use security best practices in connection with the development of the 
Developer Application and will comply at all times with all applicable privacy and data security 
laws and regulations and all security requirements of Blackboard made available on the Portal 
or otherwise.  Developer will implement security measures adequate to preserve the 
confidentiality and security of all data which is processed, stored, transmitted or handled by 
Developer or any Developer Application.

5.4.	Developer grants Blackboard the right to copy, display and otherwise use the 
registration information and materials provided by Developer for the purposes contemplated in 
the Agreement.  In addition, Blackboard shall have the right (but not the obligation) to use the 
registration information provided by Developer in order to contact Developer to inquire as to 
Developer’s interest in discussing a partner relationship with Blackboard (including, by way of 
example and at Blackboard’s sole discretion, a relationship under which Developer may be 
granted deployment rights as described in Section 6 below).  Neither party would have any 
obligations in connection with any such partner relationship unless and until the parties enter 
into a separate agreement (or an amendment hereto) which documents the terms and 
conditions of the relationship.  In addition, Developer grants Blackboard the right to use 
Developer’s name, the name of the Developer Application, and Developer’s logo and applicable 
trademarks in promotional materials and otherwise in order to promote, market and/or 
otherwise identify Developer as a registered developer of REST and/or LTI applications which 
are designed to interoperate with Blackboard Applications.

5.5.	Developer agrees to provide Blackboard the name of each Developer Application which 
is developed utilizing the APIs, a DVBA or the Documentation (each of which shall be registered 
pursuant to Section 2 above) for listing on Blackboard’s corporate website and other marketing 
vehicles.

5.6.	Developer shall not share or expose the Developer Application Key/Secret pair. 
Application Key/Secret pairs shall only be held in the Developer Application code. Similarly, the 
Developer Application must never expose the Developer Application OAuth Token. Exposing 
the Developer Application Key/Secret pair, or the OAuth Token will create a serious security 
risk. If Developer believes he/she has exposed an Application Key/Secret pair the Developer 
may request a new pair for the Developer Application using the Developer Portal My 
Applications management page.  Blackboard shall in no way be responsible for lost or exposed 
data resulting from unapproved or inappropriate use of REST Application Key/Secret pairs or 
OAuth Tokens.

**6.	DISTRIBUTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS**

In accordance with the terms and conditions above, this Agreement enables Developer to gain 
access to the APIs, Documentation and DVBA(s) to develop Developer Applications, conduct 
non-production testing of the interoperability of such Developer Applications with the 
associated Blackboard Application(s), and conduct limited, non-production demonstrations of 
such Developer Applications to prospective customers.  In addition, subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, Blackboard grants Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
limited license to  deploy (i.e., grant rights to use) Developer Applications for use by Developer 
customers in a production environment, subject to the following limitations: (a) the aggregate 
rate limit for all Developer customers for each Developer Application shall not exceed 150,000 
requests (or queries) per 24 hours; and (b) the aggregate site quota (i.e., the number of sites 
that a Developer Application may be registered with) for all Developer customers shall not 
exceed seven (7)  sites per Developer Application.  Notwithstanding the above, Developer is not 
authorized under this Agreement to, and warrants that it shall not use the DVBA in any manner 
other than for: (a) its internal, non-production development and testing of Developer 
Applications; and; (b) the non-production demonstration of Developer Applications to 
prospective customers for the limited time period authorized under Section 3 above.  For 
clarity, in no event may Developer use the DVBA for any production (i.e., “live”) use for itself or 
any customer or other party.    Developer is granted access to the DVBA for the sole purposes of 
REST and LTI testing and development, along with conducting limited demonstrations to 
prospects, all in a non-production environment and in accordance with the terms and 
conditions hereof.  In order to operate, deploy, or distribute any Developer Application beyond 
the above constraints, the Developer will be required to enter into a separate agreement with 
Blackboard which would, among other terms and conditions, require: (i) registration of each 
Developer Application; (ii) the purchase of appropriate usage limits (such as quotas, bandwidth 
limits and/or rate limits); and/or (iii) the purchase of an appropriate level of membership in the 
“Blackboard Developer Network” or similar program.  Information regarding the process for 
entering into such agreement shall be made available by Blackboard upon written request from 
Developer, on the Portal or otherwise. Developer acknowledges that its expenditure of time 
and money in developing Developer Applications is at its own risk and Blackboard makes no 
guarantees with regard to the availability of Blackboard Applications.

to the operation or security of Blackboard Applications.  Blackboard may terminate this 
Agreement immediately if Developer markets or sells any product which is substantially similar, 
in whole or material part, to any Blackboard Application.

7.3.	Termination for Convenience.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for any or no 
reason (i.e., for convenience) by providing written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) 
days prior to the effective date of such termination.

7.4.	Effect of Termination.   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, any rights 
granted pursuant to this Agreement shall cease and each party shall return (or, if so elected by

(including all copies thereof, whether electronic, hard-copy or otherwise). In addition, 
Developer shall immediately return all copies of the Blackboard APIs, Documentation and 
DVBAs.

7.5.	Suspension.  Developer agrees that, if Blackboard determines, in its sole discretion, that 
Developer has: (a) breached any term, condition or restriction of this Agreement; (b) developed 
any Developer Application or other software which poses any security or performance risk to 
any system, network, hardware, software, or technology of Blackboard or its suppliers or 
customers; (c) taken any action, or engaged in any conduct, which presents a risk of liability to 
or violation of law by Blackboard, then, in any such event, Blackboard can suspend Developer’s 
access and use of the API or Documentation, any other materials or technology made available 
by Blackboard, and any other rights or privileges provided under this Agreement.  Additionally, 
in any such event, Blackboard may require Developer to disable the interoperability of the

purposes set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) shall not disclose Confidential Information of the 
Discloser to any third party (other than employees, officers or directors of the party) except as 
expressly authorized herein or with the express written permission of the Disclosing Party. 
Notwithstanding the above, a party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to a 
third party who has a need to know, who has been pre-approved by the Disclosing Party, and 
who, prior to obtaining access to the Confidential Information, has executed a non-disclosure 
and limited use agreement approved by the Discloser.  The Recipient shall protect the 
Confidential Information of Discloser at least in the manner and degree the Recipient uses to 
protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event less than a commercially reasonable 
standard of care.

8.3.	Scope.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to: (i) information that is or becomes 
publicly available through no fault of Recipient; (ii) information that is known by Recipient prior 
to the time of disclosure hereunder; (iii) information that is lawfully obtained from a third party 
who has the right to make such disclosure without any duty of confidentiality; or (iv) any

by any representation or inducements not specifically set forth herein.  This Agreement 
supersedes any prior representations, discussion, communications or presentations.

**13.2.	Severability, Modification and Waiver.**  If any portion of this Agreement is held to be 
void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or part, the remaining portions of this 
Agreement shall remain in effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in 
writing signed by an authorized representative of each party.  A party’s failure to exercise any 
rights herein shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. If a party 
wishes to waive its rights hereunder, it must provide written notification of its waiver of such 
rights to the other party.

**13.3.	Non-exclusivity.**  This Agreement is non-exclusive.

**13.4.	Independent Contractors and Non-Interference.**  The parties are each an independent

any right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, 
on behalf of the other party or to bind the other party in any matter, including, without 
limitation, the right or authority to obligate the other party to accept or deliver any order, or to 
sell or refuse to sell to any customer.

**13.5.	Dispute Resolution.**  In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to 
this Agreement, or a breach thereof, the parties will consult and negotiate with each other and 
attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. If they do not reach settlement within a period of 
thirty (30) days, then, upon notice by any party to the other), any such controversy or claim will 
be referred to arbitration for full and final settlement by a panel of three arbitrators (or fewer if 
agreed by the Parties) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the 
International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Rules”).  All arbitration proceedings will be 
conducted in the English language and will be conducted pursuant to ICC Rules.  Any award 
issued pursuant to ICC Rules may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.  The
