<p>In August 2016, our friends at
[AllTheDucks](https://alltheducks.com) presented on their work
integrating with the Blackboard Learn REST APIs using
[Golang](https://golang.org). Following DevCon ANZ, the Ducks
were kind enough to open source their project and write a blog to help
developers learn the Golang REST Application they wrote.</p>
