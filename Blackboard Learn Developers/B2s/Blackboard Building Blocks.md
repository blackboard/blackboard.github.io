adding functionality or by integrating with external resources and services.
Learn also supports [Web
Services](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1073-blackboard-learn-
soap-web-services), [Proxy
Tools](https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1112), and [Learning Tools
Interoperability (LTI)](https://community.blackboard.com/external-
