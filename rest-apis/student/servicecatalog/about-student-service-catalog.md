The Service Catalog is a collection of Web Services made available to customers who license Anthology&reg; products.

Note: An Anthology MyCampusInsight account is required to access. https://www.mycampusinsight.com/Documentation-Center/Help/Help_Home/Content/helphome.htm

The Service Catalog system contains the Application Programming Intertace (API) documentation for SOAP-based web services and Windows Communication Foundation
(WCF) services. Ihe documentation is intended to be used by programmers familiar with consuming SOAP and WCF services.

For Anthology Student, this help system supports the current CampusLink API version and two prior versions. Topics that have been added or modified during the release cycle display a version selector at the top of the topic pane. Use the version selector to reveal content for prior versions.
