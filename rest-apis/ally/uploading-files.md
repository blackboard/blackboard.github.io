# Upload a file to Ally

Start the process by uploading the file you would like to get feedback for. This is a multipart POST request. The response will contain the statusUrl that you can poll to check whether the file has been processed. If the file was processed previously, a resourceUrl will be provided through which you can fetch the feedback information immediately.

## Supported content types

- PDF files
- Microsoft® Word files
- Microsoft® PowerPoint® files
- OpenOffice/LibreOffice files
- Uploaded HTML files
- Image files (JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BPM, TIFF)

### Endpoint

```http
POST /api/v2/clients/:clientId/content
```

### Path Parameters

- **clientId** - Path parameter - Your Ally Client ID

### Body Parameters

- **file** - Post parameter - The binary file data

### Query Parameters

- None

## Expected response

There are two potential outcomes:

1. The file is new and will be processed asynchronously. The endpoint will return with a 202 Accepted response and the following response body:

   ```json
   {
       "hash": "UkVBRE1FLm1k...",
       "status": "pending",
       "statusUrl": "/api/v2/clients/:clientId/content/UkVBRE1FLm1k.../status,
       "resourceUrl": null
   }
   ```

   | Parameter   | Definition                                                       |
   | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | hash        | the content hash used to reference the file by Ally as a Service |
   | status      | the stage of processing the file is in\*                         |
   | statusUrl   | the endpoint to call to check the status                         |
   | resourceUrl | the endpoint to retrieve the report or metadata                  |

   \*The following status values can be identified:

   - success
   - pending
   - inprogress
   - failed

2. The file has been processed before. The endpoint will return a `303 See Other` with a `Location` header to the feedback URL

### Testing with cURL

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer myJwtToken" \
  -F"file=@test.pdf" https://prod.ally.ac/api/v2/clients/:clientId/content
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

This section contains answers to many of the common questions we field as developers are on-boarding to the Ally as a Service API.

### Upload - input

- **Q: I have questions about the version support for each of these. For instance, which versions of Office are supported?**
  - Office 365, Office 2016, LibreOffice 5.2, LibreOffice 5.4
- **Q: What image file formats are supported?**
  - Most image types whose mimetype starts with image/
- **Q: Are there constraints on images: sizes, resolution?**
  - No
- **Q: Are there any restrictions on HTML files? What about external references in the HTML files?**
  - External references will be resolved and included for the HTML accessibility check, but the files themselves will not be checked.
- **Q: Is there support for HTML archive formats?**
  - No
- **Q: Is there any support for archive format: zip, tar?**
  - No

### Upload - mechanics

- **Q: We’re posting into an end-point protected with TLS 1.2 or higher, right?**
  - Yes. We use standard AWS security practices (ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01)
- **Q: Related to the archive question, are we posting the raw file, or is it organized in a multipart/form-data?**
  - Raw Files are uploaded through a multipart upload. One file at a time.
- **Q: What’s the maximum file size?**
  - There is a 50MB file size limit. We're gathering feedback on how large this limit should be to support our customers.
- **Q: Does the endpoint require a particular encoding?**
  - UTF-8 is recommended
- **Q: Does the POST have to have an accurate Content-Length: header?**
  - Yes
- **Q: Do the authentication tokens expire?**
  - No
- **Q: If we had N writers submitting to this API, would each have to have a separate authentication token?**
  - No
- **Q: Can we submit compressed files? No If so, what compression does Ally support?**
  - None
- **Q: For the 303/See Other response, if we mistakenly permitted two writers to submit the same file in some brief period, would that automatically be caught? How long is that window?**
  - Yes

### Upload - output

- **Q: I’m especially surprised to see the (x0,y0,x1,y) notation for errors. Can you tell me more about that?**
  - These are coordinates for areas in the document that contain some accessibility issue. They are coordinates that correspond to our PDF preview version.
- **Q: The output meta data contains “isVersioned”. Is there a standard way to present versions of documents when we post them?**
  - No, see next answer.
- **Q: The meta data contains a “name”, “description” and other parameters. But these are not reflections of arguments in the initial POST. Is this just an indication that there’s a richer set of arguments for the submission phase?**
  - These parameters are artifacts from our LMS API. They will be removed shortly as they carry no function in a standalone function.
