# Blackboard App for Students Launch Schema

You can link into the Blackboard app from other applications. With deep linking, a uniform resource identifier (URI) links to a specific location within the mobile app rather than simply launching the app. Use the provided schemas to link to specific features in the Blackboard app.

> **Note**: _the app-to-app launch schema changed from the bbstudent:// prefix to the blackboard:// prefix in June, 2017. Please be sure your schema is updated. This functionality is not available for the Blackboard Instructor app._
