# What is DVBA

### Developer Versions of Blackboard Applications

Blackboard makes developer versions of our applications available to integrators for development work. Currently Blackboard makes available the following developer versions of Blackboard applications (DVBAs).

#### Developer Amazon Machine Image

(AMI) is available in the Amazon Marketplace. It is pre-built and configured to allow you to access a Learn SaaS, Ultra-enabled instance of Blackboard. You can use it to build Learning Tools Interoperability integrations (LTIs) and Blackboard REST integrations. For more information, see Using the Developer AMI.

#### Developer Virtual Machine

(DVM) is a downloadable VirtualBox image built and managed with Vagrant. With it, you can run a local copy of Blackboard Learn for building LTIs, REST, and Building Blocks. For more information, see Developer Virtual Machine - DVM.

#### Blackboard Collaborate Development Instance

is a SaaS-based development system that allows developers to build integrations for Blackboard Collaborate with the Ultra Experience using the Collaborate REST APIs. For access, send a request to developers@blackboard.com.
