# Data types for contentHandler

Learn's `/contents` endpoints accommodate different types of content
by using different handlers. Use the contentHandler field of requests and
responses to indicate which content handler should be used. Available
contentHandlers their uses are summarized below.

Supported handlers include:

| contentHandler ID                                            | Description                                                                                                   | Supported since |
