# Demo using Golang

In August 2016, our friends at [AllTheDucks](https://www.alltheducks.com) presented on their work integrating with the Learn REST APIs using [Golang](https://golang.org).

Following DevCon ANZ, the Ducks were kind enough to open source their project and write a blog to help developers learn the Golang REST Application they wrote.

The blog can be found [here](https://www.alltheducks.com/blog/using-the-learn-rest-api-from-golang).
