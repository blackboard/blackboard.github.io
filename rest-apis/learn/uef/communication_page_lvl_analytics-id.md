## Introduction

The idea of this development is the let the UEF integration know if an analytics-id exists (or not) on the page, so if our Integration Partners want to add some functionality on the screen based on the elements visibility, they are sure of the object they want to target.

## Outline of page-level analytics-id to integration

In order to provide a number of key functionalities that are already being offered in Learn Original, client needs the ability to ask UEF about the presence of specific elements in the current focused panel and in view port on the page based on the analytics-id. The response will be a true or false as to whether the element is present on screen.

## Batch Processing and Rate-limiting

All the requests received under one second will be batched and a single response will be sent at the end of one second to its respective integration portal.

- If Single Integration - rate limiting to 20 requests / second.
- If Multiple Integration - rate limiting to 15 requests /second to each integration.

> The timer will be initiated on any first request.

## Request Structure

Two key's must be present in request Json -> **Type and AnalyticsIds.**

- **Type** → This key must contain the String value which indicates the request type and purpose of request.

- **AnalyticsIds** → This key should have the list of analytics Id's for which the page components presence will be checked in current view port and in active panel with 100% visibility.

The type of this request event integration will be always **"analytics:visible"**

Below is the example of request structure

### Request Event

```json
{
"type":"analytics:visible",
"analyticsIds":["analyticsId", "analyticsId", ...]
}
```

## Response Structure

Two key's will be present in response Json -> **Type** and **Result**. This response will have all "analyticsId" which was sent in request event along with "isElementVisible" flag to indicate whether the requested analytic Id is present in view port and in active panel with 100% visibility or not.

- **Type** → This will have String value that indicates request type and purpose of request.
- **Result** → This will have two parameters -> AnalyticsId and isElementVisible.
- **AnalyticsId** → This key will have the analytics id that was sent in request event.
- **isElementVisible** → This key will have either True/False that indicates whether the given analytics ID is visible in view port and in active panel with 100% visibility or not.

### Response event

```json
{
        "type": "analytics:visible",
        "results" : [ {
                        "analyticsId": "analyticsId from UEF",
                        "isElementVisible": true/false
                    },
                    {
                        "analyticsId": "analyticsId from UEF",
                        "isElementVisible": true/false
                    } , ...
                  ]
}
```

### Interface

```json
1.  IIntegrationPageAnalyticsRequest {
    type: typeof ANALYTICS_VISIBLE_TYPE;
    analyticsIds: string[];
   }


2. IIntegrationPageAnalyticsResult {
   analyticsId: string;
   isElementVisible: boolean;
   }



3. IIntegrationPageAnalyticsResponse {
   type: typeof ANALYTICS_VISIBLE_TYPE;
   Results: IIntegrationPageAnalyticsResult[];
  }
```

### Enum

IntegrationPageAnalytics

1. ANALYTICS_RATE_LIMIT = 20
2. MULTIPLE_INTEGRATION_ANALYTICS_RATE_LIMIT = 15
3. ANALYTICS_TIMEOUT = 1000

### Const:

1. ANALYTICS_VISIBLE_TYPE = 'analytics:visible';
