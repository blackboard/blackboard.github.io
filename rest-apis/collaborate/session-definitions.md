# Session Definitions

In Blackbard Collaborate, Sessions are what lies at the center of everything. This is the virtual room that you enroll users to, share content, and host your live course events. The purpose of this document is to define the settings available to you, the developer, when you create a new session through the Collaborate REST API.

For illustration, here is a sample session event that would be sent to POST /sessions.

```json
{
  "name": "My Collab Room",
  "description": "The room I use for Collab meetings",
  "startTime": "2020-03-27T16:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2020-03-27T17:00:00.000Z",
  "noEndDate": true,
  "createdTimezone": "America/New_York",
  "courseRoomEnabled": false,
  "boundaryTime": "15",
  "participantCanUseTools": true,
  "occurrenceType": "S",
  "recurrenceRule": {

    "interval": "1",
    "numberOfOccurrences": 0,
    "endDate": "2020-03-27T17:00:00.000Z"
  },
