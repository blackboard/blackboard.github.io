## Our Premium APIs

### Ultra Extension Framework

UEF is a set of Premium APIs that augment the Ultra experience of 
Blackboard Learn. We designed a robust set of capabilities such as 
telemetry, help provider registration, and UI element rendering to 
enable better integrations and richer user experience.
