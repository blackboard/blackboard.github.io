# Code Quality Initiative

## Why Code Quality Matters

- Your code is your asset
- Keeps your cost down as you grow
- Increase robustness, maintainability, security, performance, scalability, extensibility, etc.
- Prevention is the best medicine

#### Challenges with Code Quality

- Often talked about in theory but not actually practiced
- Hard to measure or prove
- Difficult to plan and prioritize

#### Sonar â€“ Quality Management Platform

[http://www.sonarsource.org/](https://www.sonarsource.org)

- Open source and extensible
- Manages code quality with:
  - Views of all projects at a glace, drill down to source code, differential, hotspots
  - Coding Rules
  - Unit Tests
  - Standard Metrics
  - Time Machine
  - Integration with tools such as PMD, Findbugs, Checkstyle, JSLint, Clover, Cobetura, Hudson (many plugins available)

#### Static Code Analysis (SCA)

- Applies rules to find potential bugs, anti-patterns, and code style violations
- Catches problems as early as possible in the development process
- A well-established industry practice for validating the quality of source code
- Can be automated and tracked by tools like Sonar
