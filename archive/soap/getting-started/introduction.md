# Introduction to SOAP Web Services

Blackboard Learn Web Services are a key component of Blackboard Learn's open
architecture, allowing you to enhance the online education experience for
their students and faculty through integration with external services and
applications. You may assemble a solution of homegrown, commercial and open
source software and tools using Learn Web Services that best meets your needs
whether it is an integration to a homegrown application or other enterprise
application, or seamless integration to a subscription database at your
library.

Through Blackboard Learn Web Services developers can integrate with enterprise
web applications such as Student Information Systems or custom middle-tier
services. The Learn Web Services ensure that you can:

- provision data to Learn from external systems and vice versa.
- provide customizations to meet system integration and architecture needs
- leverage this technology to enhance and aid administration of their systems on campus
- automate procedures or repetitive tasks
- integrate with external systems or applications across your learning enterprise for example the Registrar's office, the Library to name just two
- customize your implementation by integrating open source or locally-developed applications and tools

Data that can be accessed includes:

- User data - name, course of study, contact information
- Course data and Enrollment records
- Outcomes - student quiz and test data, scores, grades, participation and activity data
- Content - the ability to seamlessly integrate rich content from a variety of sources
- System management - information to help administrators manage and monitor their Blackboard software installations

#### Request a Developers License

All Blackboard Learn clients receive a Blackboard developers license at no

the Community and Content Management modules turned on. It can be run on a
development server or even a virtual machine image for development purposes.
If you require a developer network account visit [Behind the Blackboard](https://blackboard.secure.force.com/) (as an
administrator) or contact your sales representative.

#### Commercial Partnerships

If you are interested in becoming a Blackboard partner visit the [Blackboard Partnerships](https://www.blackboard.com/partnerships/partnerships-program.aspx)â„¢ program site. Partnering with Blackboard provides access to
design guidance and support among other benefits.
