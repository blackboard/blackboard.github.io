# LTI In Learn - Turn On All The Switches
### Overview
We often hear about this message "The Tool Provider has been disabled by the System Administrator"  The usual cause is that one of the 3 LTI switches is disabled. There are 3 places you need to enable LTI: (1) at the tool level, (2) at the course/organization level, and (3) at the LTI Global Properties level. Screenshots follow. **LAST, BUT NOT LEAST - Make certain you are enrolled in the course, as an instructor or student, before using the LTI placements you create in a course! Your launch will fail if you don't have a role in the course.**

### All the Switches
(1) Administrator Panel -> Tools & Utilities section -> Tools
